traceability


it is to make a place, used on your phone

to scan a code of things

and get the trace of it



it may trace nonGMO radioactive ethical rights salubrity democracy and all other sorts of things depending    

we don't know what it will trace but it has to be able to   



from the sowing to the harvest to the shipping to the distribution   

 wiki in its use 
 
 we give the medium  
 
 they use it  



to do things you can 

fork it and do a part of it 

submit an issue, a thing you want in it  

make a useful comment, stay constructive  

ask experts and medias to do things 


you need not to take things personnal   
and once it is published it is theirs  

the license is 'commons', changeit use it let other do it too,
